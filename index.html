        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS is used to style an element directly in a HTML file.</li>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheets are the most common way to style a page.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a LINK element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          <li>“Separation of Concerns” is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: Blue includes the CSS property COLOR and the vale for the property, BLUE.</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused with margin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property adds space around the content INSIDE an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger.</li>
          <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors. Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself code.</li>
          <li>A LINK element creates the connection to an external file. Like an external CSS Style Sheet for example.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue, We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line.</li>
            <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
            <li>We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
            <li>The src code to link the .js file will go below the footer and before the closing body element.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom.</li>
            <li>An IF statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. When using the if statement, code will only execute IF the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
            <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
            <l>Arrays can contain more than one type of data. For example, a string, a number, or even Boolean values can be grouped together in an array</l>
            <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
            <li>You can assign an index according to the order in which each item is stored in the array.</li>
            <li>If we want to access a specific item in an array, we start with the name of the variable that stores the array, then we add the index to the end of it in square brackets.</li>
            <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code black to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement to interrupt the control dflow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
            <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:
              The first Statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable X and give it a value of 0.
              The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute on time for each item in the array.
              The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by  each time. The code X++ is a shortcut way of writing X+. Every time the code loops, X will increase by 1.</li>
            <li>At the most basic level, a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
            <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not auto execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it. </li>
            <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. Then we add a {} that contains the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
