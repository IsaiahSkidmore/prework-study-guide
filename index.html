        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS is used to style an element directly in a HTML file.</li>
          <li>External CSS Style Sheets are the most common way to style a page.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a LINK element placed in the HTMLs head.</li>
          <li>“Separation of Concerns” is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. For example, the declaration color: Blue includes the CSS property COLOR and the vale for the property, BLUE.</li>
          <li>The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer.</li>
          <li>The padding property is often confused with margin, but it is not the same thing. The padding property ads space around the content INSIDE an element. When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger.</li>
          <li>You can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors. Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself code.</li>
          <li>A LINK element creates the connection to an external file. Like an external CSS Style Sheet for example.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue, We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code</li>
